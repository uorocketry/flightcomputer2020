# flightcomputer2020
This repo contains EAGLE and other design files for PCBs in the 2020-2010 flight campaign. 

## How to Use
We're going to be learning how to best use this repo together, but for now, here are some best practices:
1. If you need access to this folder, please reach out to either Magdalena or Sebastien on Slack or Discord (links will not be posted here).
2. Create your own folder under your name.  For now, we're going to push and pull everything straight from the master branch, and when we start comparing, reviewing, and blending our designs, we'll start different branches.
3. Make sure you save all the files generated by whichever CAD software you're using and push them to your folder.

## Resources
1. Link to the [student version of EAGLE] (https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&page=1) (you need to use your student email)
2. Link to [Fritzing] (https://www.filehorse.com/download-fritzing-64/download/) for protoboard design
3. Best site for BUYING components: [Mouser.ca] (https://www.mouser.ca/)
4. Best site for LIBRARY FILES For components: [Digikey.ca] (https://www.digikey.ca/)

## Decision Log

##### Sep. 19, 2020
Big take-aways for the day:
1. Using 9V on RRC3 --> Remove need for brownout protection, current limiting.
2. Making a pi-hat from a protoboard to fit on top of Pi (most preferable if height does not exceed USB jacks)
3. Still need a switch
4. Still need a voltage converter
5. Still need rails from batteries into pi-hat.
6. Keep using Github
7. Download/ use Fritzring for visualizing final pi hat
8. Update markdown file to include all of this.
